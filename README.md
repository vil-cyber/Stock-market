User: Can register by verifying their email with an OTP. Can log in after registration and view stocks available for purchase. Can recharge their wallet using the Razorpay API to purchase stocks. Can view their portfolio and sell stocks.

This application handles sessions for authentication and does not use traditional security frameworks like Spring Security.

Installation Prerequisites Java (JDK 17 or higher) Maven for dependency management MySQL database Razorpay API Key (for wallet recharge functionality) Alpha Vantage API Key (for fetching stock details) Email API key (for OTP email verification)

Steps Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/saishkulkarni/stock-market-springboot-thymeleaf.git

Set up the MySQL Database: Create a new database for the application. Update the application.properties file with your MySQL database credentials.

Example: spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/stock_market spring.datasource.username=root spring.datasource.password=password

Configure External APIs: Alpha Vantage API: Obtain an API key and add it to the application.properties file. Razorpay API: Obtain your Razorpay API key and add it to the application.properties file.

Run the Application: mvn spring-boot:run

Access the Application: Visit http://localhost in your web browser to access the application.

Database Schema The application uses a MySQL database with the following key tables: users: Stores user information (email, password, wallet balance). stocks: Stores information about the stocks available (ticker, stock details). transactions: Stores transactions related to stock purchases and sales. admin_details: Stores the platform fees collected from users.

API Integration Alpha Vantage API The application uses the Alpha Vantage API to fetch stock data based on the ticker symbol provided by the admin. The data includes stock prices, company information, etc., which are then stored in the database.

Razorpay API Razorpay API is used for wallet recharge functionality. Users can add funds to their wallet using Razorpay.

Java Mail Sender The application uses Java Mail Sender to send OTP emails to users during the registration process.

Session Management Instead of using Spring Security, the application manages user sessions directly: When users log in, a session is created to track their logged-in state. Admin and user sessions are handled separately to ensure proper access control.
